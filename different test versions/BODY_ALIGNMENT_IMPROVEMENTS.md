# 🎯 Enhanced Body Alignment Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced `simple_perfect_tryon_1.py` with advanced body alignment features for perfect garment fitting.

## Key Improvements

### 🔍 **Precise Body Measurements**
- **9+ Pose Landmarks**: Uses shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, and nose for comprehensive analysis
- **Body Center Calculation**: Finds true center point between shoulder and hip centers
- **Arm Length Analysis**: Measures average arm length for sleeve fitting
- **Body Taper Ratio**: Calculates shoulder-to-hip ratio for natural shape adaptation

### 🔄 **Automatic Rotation Alignment**
- **Shoulder Angle Detection**: Measures body tilt using shoulder landmark positions
- **Smart Rotation**: Automatically rotates garment to match body angle (±15° limit)
- **Natural Positioning**: Prevents over-rotation for realistic appearance

### 📐 **Body Shape Adaptation**
- **Taper Adjustment**: Adjusts garment width based on body taper ratio
- **Perspective Transformation**: Uses perspective warping for natural body shape following
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Calculates optimal garment dimensions based on actual body measurements

### 🎨 **Enhanced Rendering**
- **High-Quality Interpolation**: LANCZOS4 for superior image quality
- **Edge Smoothing**: Advanced alpha blending with edge feathering
- **Anti-Aliasing**: Reduces jagged edges on rotated garments
- **Soft Transparency**: Gaussian blur for natural edge transitions

## Technical Features

### **New Functions Added**
1. `calculate_precise_body_measurements()` - Comprehensive body analysis
2. `create_body_aligned_garment()` - Smart garment transformation
3. Enhanced `enhance_garment_alpha_blending()` - Professional rendering

### **Real-Time Display**
- **Body Angle**: Shows current body tilt in degrees
- **Taper Ratio**: Displays shoulder-to-hip ratio
- **Alignment Status**: Confirms when perfect alignment is achieved

### **Automatic Adjustments**
- **Position Optimization**: Centers garment on true body center
- **Size Scaling**: 130% of shoulder width, 140% of torso height
- **Boundary Checking**: Ensures garment stays within frame
